To make the inventory dynamic for ec2  instances download 2 file `ec2.py` and `ec2.ini` from [here](https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/stable-2.9/contrib/inventory)
and follow the steps below
 * Make a new folder. let assume "myfolder"
 * download them into myfolder folder
   -  * In the *ec2.py* file comment out this line`from ansible.module_utils import ec2 as ec2_utils`
   -  make them executable with command `chmod +x ec2.*`
 * type this in terminal to initalise environment variable that is used by dynamic inventory
   -  export AWS_ACCESS_kEY_ID=your_Access_Key
   -  export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY= your_secret_key
 * In ansible configuration file i.e. in path */ect/ansible/ansible.cfg*
    **Note:** If file don't exists ,make file `ansible.cfg` in that path and write.
